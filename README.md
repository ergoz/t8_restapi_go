Goclipse IDE, auto-formatting with CMD+SHIFT+F, (some) code completion and syntax check, and AppEngine friendly (sort of).

Google Cloud SDK, to handle Appengine, Appengine GO SDK, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, etc. And the Google Eclipse plugin

GORM as a db abstraction layer/orm... It has some minor things I dislike, but it seems pretty mature/well tested, and very well documented.
	https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm
	
	GORP seems nice enough, but besides the same things I dislike on GORM, it forces you to rely exclusively on writing SQL and concatenated string for SELECT ... WHERE and similar stuff

Gorilla Web Tookit to handle JSON-RPC, sessions, authentication and context... ah, and it's Google AppEngine friendly
	http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/

JSON-RPC v2.0 ... nice and simple. Clearer, simpler and more suited to this than the RESTful meta-protocols. And it's Go-UnitTest friendly.
	http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification

Documentation with GODOC, the official documentation tool... not pretty, but std in GO world.
	http://localhost:6060/pkg/table8/restaurant_api/

Scripts to try and normalize the mess that GO + AppEngine + GoClipse paths and configurations are, to run several tools and perform ops.

Good sample of unit tests... both Go tests, and remote tests (remote tests: in a different language, even in another computer).
